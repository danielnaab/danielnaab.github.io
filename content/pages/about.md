Hello, I'm Daniel Naab. I live in [beautiful Madison, WI](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=Beautiful+Madison%2C+WI) with my [wife](https://www.kismetbydesign.com/) and two sons.

I help solve problems with elegantly-architected software. Working at [Flexion](https://flexion.us/), I help research and build solutions for the [10x program](https://10x.gsa.gov/), an incubator for digital innovation in government.

With a background in multiple software disciplines, as well as a breadth of experience in all phases of the software development cycle, I have experience solving a wide range of problems and enjoy taking on new challenges.
