Title: About Me
Date: 2014-07-26 16:04

Hello, I'm Daniel Naab. I live in [beautiful Madison, WI][madison] with my
[girlfriend](http://kismetbydesign.com) and crazy dog, and help companies
solve their problems with elegantly architected web infrastructure.

With a background in multiple software disciplines, as well as a breadth of
experience in all phases of the software development cycle, I have experience
solving a wide range of problems and enjoy taking on new challenges.

When I'm not working for clients, I can either be found pulling weeds in the
garden or working on my super-secret side project to take over the world.
