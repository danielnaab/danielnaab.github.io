I've been using Django since 2006 and Python since 2000, but for many years
working with these great tools was only done on side projects. Slowly,
however, I found myself doing more and more projects, and, since last year,
working for myself primarily in the Python world. Working with these tools,
I've had the pleasure of helping build several interesting and challenging
projects. Python and Django has always felt like the language and platform
most natural and productive to work with, so for me, it's my go-to combo for
many problems.

So when I heard from a friend and former colleague, [Brandon Taylor][1], about
the possibility of collaborating with him on a [Packt Publishing][2] title
focused on designing Django applications, I jumped at the chance. Packt has a
"Blueprint" series, for which Brandon has proposed and starting work on
*Django Project Blueprints*. I've joined him as co-author to write several of
the chapters and collaborate on the others. I'm pretty excited to work with as
talented a developer/designer as Brandon on this project, and become a
"published author" in the process.

*Django Project Blueprints* will outline the design of four projects, of
varying degrees of complexity and application stack. Each project will go
beyond the typical how-to book, requiring familiarity with the language and
framework, but describe useful patterns for creating non-trivial projects,
in a traditional step-by-step manner. In addition to assistance laying out
largish projects, *Django Project Blueprints* touch on several concepts:

- Geo data with GeoDjango
- Extracting EXIF data from images
- Creating a RESTful api with django-rest-framework
- Processing credit card transactions
- Real-time client/server communication with socket.io

I plan on following up this post with updates on my progress and give my
perspective on what it's like to (without prior experience) write a technical
how-to book.
